# MERN Project

- This project was made using React and the main feature is that we are using MongoDB, Express, Node and React. This is the most complete project I have made where you can find a MVC architecture, and a RESTful API.
- In the client side we are using Context Provider and Consumer to pass data from the parent to the child.
- In the server side we are using Mongoose to connect to the database and create a schema.

Aditional features:
- We are using the JWT authentication to login and protect the routes.
- Password encryption using bcrypt.
- Most recent documentation of React and Node.
